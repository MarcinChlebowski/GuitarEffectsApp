# GuitarEffectsApp

 The work presents an application for processing guitar audio. The program was developed in the Python programming language, making use of libraries such as Tkinter for creating the graphical interface and pedalboard for implementing audio effects.
 The functionality of the program relies on the pedalboard library, enabling users to choose from a selection of available effects. Additionally, users have the option to customize parameters associated with each effect.
